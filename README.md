## About The Project

InterviewAI is a full-stack web application designed to help job seekers prepare for technical interviews. It simulates a real interview experience by having a conversation with an AI powered by Google's Gemini model. Users can choose an interview topic, answer questions using voice or text, and receive instant, detailed feedback on their responses. The platform tracks progress over time, providing a comprehensive history and performance analytics to help users identify their strengths and weaknesses.

This project was built to showcase a modern, end-to-end application using a popular and powerful tech stack, and to demonstrate the capabilities of conversational AI in a practical, helpful tool.
